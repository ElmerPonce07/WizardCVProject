# Wizard Fight - Hand Gesture Magic Duel Game

## Overview

Wizard Fight is an interactive computer vision-based game that allows players to engage in magical duels using hand gestures. Players cast spells by making specific hand gestures that are detected through their computer's webcam using MediaPipe hand tracking technology.

## Features

- **Three Elemental Spells**: Fire, Water, and Earth with rock-paper-scissors mechanics
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Easy (2.5s reaction time), Medium (1.5s), and Hard (0.75s)
- **Dynamic Health System**: Both player and AI mage have 100 HP with damage tracking
- **Round-based Combat**: Turn-based spell casting with reaction time mechanics

### Visual Elements

- **Animated Title Screen**: Interactive menu with difficulty selection
- **Mage Animations**: Idle, attack, victory, and defeat animations using video files
- **Real-time Camera Feed**: Live webcam display with hand tracking visualization
- **Health Bars**: Visual HP tracking for both player and mage
- **Spell Announcements**: Dynamic text display showing current spells and countdown timers

### Technical Features

- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **High Performance**: Optimized for 120 FPS display
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of core logic, UI, and game mechanics
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing camera or video files

## Technical Architecture

### Core Module (`core/`)

- **gameLogic.py**: Contains spell counters, difficulty settings, and game evaluation logic
- **gestureUtils.py**: Hand landmark processing and spell detection algorithms
- **launch_game.py**: Entry point with proper path handling and error management
- **main.py**: Simple hand tracking demonstration

### UI Module (`ui/`)

- **wizard_duel_game.py**: Main game loop, camera handling, and game state management
- **title_screen.py**: Interactive menu system with difficulty selection
- **game_display.py**: Video animation management and UI rendering

### Key Technologies

- **OpenCV**: Computer vision and video processing
- **MediaPipe**: Hand tracking and landmark detection
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and array handling

## Hand Tracking System

### Landmark Detection

The game uses MediaPipe's hand tracking to detect 21 hand landmarks:

- **Finger Tips**: Landmarks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20
- **Finger PIP Joints**: Landmarks 3, 7, 11, 15, 19
- **Thumb Special Handling**: Uses X-coordinate comparison for sideways movement

### Gesture Recognition Algorithm

1. **Thumb Detection**: Compares X-coordinates with tolerance for sideways movement
2. **Finger Detection**: Compares Y-coordinates of tips vs PIP joints with tolerance
3. **Spell Mapping**: Maps finger combinations to spell types with multiple acceptable variations

### Tolerance System

- **Thumb Tolerance**: 0.02 units for sideways movement
- **Finger Tolerance**: 0.01 units for vertical movement
- **Multiple Gesture Support**: Accepts variations of the same spell for better reliability

## Performance Optimization

### Frame Rate Management

- **Target FPS**: 120 FPS for smooth animations
- **Frame Timing**: Consistent 8ms intervals between frames
- **Animation Synchronization**: Video playback synchronized with game timing

### Memory Management

- **Video Streaming**: Efficient video file handling with looping
- **Camera Resources**: Proper cleanup of OpenCV camera objects
- **Window Management**: Controlled window creation and destruction

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Working

- Ensure webcam is connected and not in use by other applications
- Check camera permissions in your operating system
- Try running with `python3 core/main.py` to test basic camera functionality

#### Hand Tracking Issues

- Ensure adequate lighting
- Keep hands clearly visible to the camera
- Avoid rapid hand movements
- Check that MediaPipe is properly installed

#### Video Files Missing

- Ensure all `.mkv` files are in the `assets/` folder
- Check file permissions
- Verify video files are not corrupted

#### Performance Issues

- Close other applications using the camera
- Ensure sufficient system resources
- Try reducing the game window size

### Error Messages

- **"Failed to grab frame"**: Camera access issue
- **"Could not open [video file]"**: Missing or corrupted video assets
- **"Could not import required modules"**: Missing Python dependencies

## Development Notes

### Code Style

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns between modules
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks and fallbacks
- **Documentation**: Inline comments explaining complex logic
- **Consistent Naming**: Descriptive variable and function names

### Extensibility

The project is designed for easy extension:

- **New Spells**: Add to `gestureUtils.py` and `gameLogic.py`
- **New Animations**: Add video files to `assets/` and update `game_display.py`
- **New Difficulty Levels**: Modify `gameLogic.py` difficulty settings
- **New UI Elements**: Extend `game_display.py` display methods

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements and additions:

- **Multiplayer Support**: Network-based player vs player
- **Custom Gestures**: User-defined spell gestures
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for spells and actions
- **Save System**: Progress tracking and high scores
- **Mobile Support**: Touch-based gesture recognition
